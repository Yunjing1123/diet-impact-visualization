# Diet Environmental Impact Visualization (COMP4037 Assignment 2)

This project visualizes the environmental impacts of different dietary types using data from the Nature Food paper by Scarborough et al. (2023). It is developed as part of COMP4037 Research Methods coursework.

## Visualizations

- **Radar Chart**: Normalized environmental impact of each diet (GHG emissions, land, water, biodiversity, etc.)
- **Heatmap**: Raw values of environmental indicators for each diet group

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Google Colab
- Dataset: [`Scarborough et al., 2023`](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43016-023-00795-w)

## Files

- `diet_analysis.ipynb`: The complete notebook including data processing, plotting, and chart exporting
- `radar_chart.png`: Final radar chart visualization
- `heatmap_chart.png`: Final heatmap visualization
